#+TITLE: Overview (per week) of Dynamical Systems
** Week 1

*** Euler Lagrange Equations

If there are k constraints, there are $k$  equations which are functions
of the coordinates of each of the $N$ particles.

There are $3N-k$ degrees of freedom, each of which can have their own
equation. These are \[ q_j = q_j(x_1,y_1,z_1, ..., x_N, y_N, z_N, t)\]
They can also be called generalized coordinates.

The inverse transformation is given as a function of all of the generalized
coordinates.
** Week 2
*** Hamiltonian
- This is given as the Legendre transformation of the Lagrangian:
- $H = \Sum_i p_i \dot{q_i} - L_i$
- It can be shown that this does not lead to a loss of information
- By taking the derivative with respect to $q_i$ and $p_i$
- And using some identities from Week 1
- The Hamiltonian *must* only be a function of generalised momentum and coordinate
  - Substitute away the velocity
*** Hamilton's Equations 
- $\frac{\partial H}{\partial p_i} = \dot{q_i}$
- $\frac{\partial H}{\partial q_i} = \dot{-p_i}$
- If H is independent of a certain coordinate $q_i$, then the momentum is conserved
- If $\frac{\partial H}{\partial t} = 0$, then H is constant, givn by $H=T-V$
*** Hamiltonian Systems
- Dynamical systems are given by: $\\dot{q}=F_1(q,p), \quad \dot{p}=F_2(q,p)$
- It is Hamiltonian if $\frac{\partial F_1}{\partial q} + \frac{\partial F_2}{\partial p}=0$
*** Conserved Quantities
- In general a Lagrangian with a general K.E. and a potential $V(q_i)$
- Can be shown to be $H=T+V$
- Also because $\frac{dH}{dt} = -\frac{\partial L}{\partial t}
*** Poisson Brackets
- A function of $f(q_i,p_i,t)$ has a time-dependence of:
- $\frac{df}{dt} = \Sum_i\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial q_i}\dot{q_i}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial p_i}\dot{p_i} \right) + \frac{\partial f}{\partial t}$
- Make appropiate substitutions with Hamilton's Equations
- ${f,g} = \Sum_i\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial q_i}\frac{\partial g}{\partial \dot{p_i}}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial p_i}\frac{\partial g}{\partial \dot{q_i}} \right)$ 
**** Properties of Poisson Brackets
     - Linear
     - Satisfies Jacobi Identity: ${{f,g},h}+{{h,f},g}+{{g,h},f} =0$
     - Satisfies Leibniz Rule: $ {f,gh}=g{f,h}+{f,g}h$
*** Phase Space
- A space that is composed of $x(t) = (p_i(t),q_i(t))$
*** Liouville's Theorem
- The volume of a Hamiltonian system is unchanged (can change shape though)
- With the Divergence Theorem:
- $\frac{dV}{dt} = \int_V \Nabla \dot \dot{x} dC = 0$
** Week 3
*** Hamiltonian
    - Is always given in terms of momentum and general coordinate:
    - i.e. $H = H(p_\theta, \theta)$
    - And not $\ddot{\theta}$ for example
*** Bead on Rotating Loop
    - Basically an example in using Lagrangian and Hamilton's equation
    - Maybe go through it again from time to time
*** Small Oscillations
    - Consider a small oscillation where the potential is minimum (derivative of V is zero)
    - Masses can be related to the generalised coordinate
      - Moment of inertia for rotational coordinates
    - A general form of the Lagrangian can be written x
      - With first term being a product of coordinates (see notes)
      - Define a 'coordinate' that is the equilibrium position plus displacement
    - Do a 2D taylor expansion
      - For the potential, drop any term with power order than 2
      - For the KE, only the first mass term survives
	- The other combines with subsequent term to form higher order terms
    - A matrix formulation arises, and an ansatz of $e^{i(kx_k+\phi}$ can be used
    - The determinant gives the amplitudes of oscillations
*** Carbon Dioxide example
*** Classical Field Theory
    - Treat matter as particles lying in a 'mattress'
      - or line if 1D
    - Then take the inter-distance to be 0 and infinite particles
    - Calculate the 'action' across the coordinates
    - This forms the Lagrangian for the field
    - Substituting for string gives the wave equation
    - Lagrangian invariance:
      - The current is equal to the change in charge density
*** Important formulas:
    - Lagrangian density:
      - $L= \frac12 \left(\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t}\right)^2 - \frac{T}{2}\right(\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}\right)^2$
    - EL equation for field:
      - $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi}=\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial (\partial \phi/\partial t)}\right) + \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \right(\frac{\partial L}{\partial (\partial \phi/\partial x)}\right)$
** Week 4
*** ODEs
**** Coupled DEs
     - Basically if equations are mixed with diff. coordinates
     - Like y depends on x and z and vice versa
**** Equivalent system of 1st Order ODEs
     - Linear differential equation can be written in the form:
     - $f(\frac{d^n x}{dt^n},...,\frac{dx}{dt},t) = 0$
     - i.e. The ODE LHS is a function of derivatives to the n order
     - They are *autonomous* if there is no explicit time dependence
***** Solving
      - Any n order differential equation can be written as n first order ODE
      - $y_{i-1} = y_i$ So y equals the second highest order derivative
      - $\dot{y_{n-1}} = g(y_{n-1},...,y_1,y_0,t)$
***** Examples
      1. $0 = \ddot{x}+\gamma\dot{x}+\omega^2 x$
	 - $\dot{x} = y$
	 - $ \dot{y} = -\gamma y - \omega^2 x$
      2. $\ddot{theta} = \frac{-g}{l}\sin{\theta}
	 - Using the Hamiltonian framework
	 - $\dot{theta}=\frac{p_\theta}{ml^2}$
	 - $\dot{p_\theta} = -mgl\sin{\theta}$
**** Existence and Uniqueness 
     - In vector form: $\dot{x} = g(x,t)$
     - Which is to have a column vector of $\dot{x_i}$ equal to
     - Column vector of $g_i(x_1,x_2,...,x_n,t)$
***** Theorem
      - If $g(x,t)$ and all first order derivatives are continous and
       contain a point $x_0$
      - Solution to the matrix equation for initial condition
       $x(t_0)=x_0$ must exist and is unique
***** Breakdown
      - Consider $\dot{x} = \sqrt{x}$
      - There are infinitely many solutions for initial condition $x(0)=0$
      - Reason being the breakdown of derivative at $x=0$
**** Fixed Points
     - Fixed points occur when $\dot{x}|_x-x_f = 0$
     - Which is when the derivative equals zero
***** Logistics Equation
      - Population growth model or rabbits:
      - $\dot{x} = x(a-bx)$
***** Solving for higher order
      1. Begin with writing out the derivative as something something
         equation as matrix
      2. The coefficients are $G$. Solve for the eigenvalue equation.
      3. Vector $\epsilon_0 = \epsilon(0) = \Sum_{i=1}^n c_i e_i$
         represents the eigenvector expansion of the vector in initial
         conditions
      4. Using above, build the ansatz for the solution as:
         $\epsilon(t)=\Sum^n_{i=1}c_ie_ie^{\lambda_i t}$
      5. Then, $\dot{\epsilon} =
         \Sum^n_{i=1}c_i\lambda_ie_ie^{\lambda_i t}$. Check and see
         that substitution with $G$ creates the linear set of ODEs
      6. Approximate solution: $x(t) = x_f + \epsilon(t)
** Week 5
*** Jordan Form
    - $J = M^{-1}AM$
*** Rabbits growth
    1. Identify fixed points (set x=0 and y=0)
    2. First equation is $g_1$, second is $g_2$
    3. Compute $G_{ij} = \frac{\partial g_i}{\partial x_j}$
    4. Compute the G for each fixed point
    5. Compute eigenvalues/eigenvectors (consider using $\lambda_{1,2}
       = \frac12\left(tr(G)\pm\sqrt{tr(G)^2-4det(G)}$
    6. 

** Week 6
*** Stability of a point in phase space
    1. Asymptotic stability
       When nearby points flow to the point x_f
    2. Liapunov Stability
       When trajectories starting near a point x_f merely stay near it.

To be precise: Suppose x(t) is a trajectory with starting point
x(t=0)=x_0 near a fixed point x_f:

1. _Liapunov Stability_: the trajectory merely stays within the circle
   $\sigma$
2. _Asymptotic Stability_: the trajectory would travel back to the
   fixed point after $t\to\infty$

*** Liapunov Stability Theorem      

Consider a system $\dot{x} = g(x)$ with a fixed point at the
origin. If there exists a function $V(x)$ defined in a region $R$
contained 0 with properties:

1. The partial derivatives are continuous
2. The function is positive definite (all positive for all x) except at 0
3. The total time derivative is negative (semi) definite (all negative for all x) except at 0

Then the origin 0 is asymoptotically stable. Note:
- Negative defininite means $V < 0$
- Negative semi definite means $V \leq 0$

See page 79 for an example which illustrates using this theorem.

$V(x)$ is not easy to find, but one can always try circles or ellipses.

Note: FP is global stable. Attrats all trajectories.  

*** Limit Cycles

Instead of converging at fixed points, the trajectories may converge
to a closed curve or periodic orbits. For a trajectory $\Gamma$ and a
neighbourhood defined by $N(\Gamma,\epsilon)$:

1. _Liapunov Orbital Stability_: The trajectory lies inside the
   neighbourhood.
2. _Asymtptotic Orbital Stability_: The trajectory approaches $\Gamma$.

See page 80 for example on /van der Pol oscillator/.

*** Poincare Bendixson Theorem

Consider a system $\dot{x} = g(x)$. Suppose that:

1. R is a closed bounded subset of the 2D plane.
2. The system is well defined in R and $g(x)$ is continously
   differentiable.
3. Trajectory $x(t)$ confined in R.
4. R does not contain any fixed points on the system. 

Then the trajectory is a closed orbit or it tends to a closed orbit as
t $\to \infty$.

This theorem is used to prove the existence of limit cycles. 
       
*** Linearisation (Hartman-Grobman) Theorem

As long as the eigenvalue of the Jacobian as a nonzero real component,
the phase space portrait close to the fixed point remains
qualitatively the same. i.e. Upon linearisation:

\[ \dot{x} = G_{x_f} \cdot (x-x_f) + h(x-x_f) \]

The phase portrait remains the same.

*** Symmetry

Symmetrical systems remain the same after the transformation $t\to -t,
y\to -y$. All trajecotries of the full non-linear system are closed. 


*** Additional Examples from lectures:

1. System $\dot{x} = 0, \dot{y} = -y$

Forms a system where the trajectories flow towards $x=0$ (below x axis
vertical lines go up, above x axis vertical lines go down).

2. /Liapunov Stability/  System $\dot{x} = -x^3, \dot{y} - y^3$ is a non-simple fixed point.

Choose $V(x) = x^2+y^2$ which satisfies aforementioned criteria.

3. System $\dot{x} = -x + 4y, \dot{y} = -x-y^3$ FP at origin.

Choose $V(x,y) = x^2+4y$

4. System $\dot{x} = y+x(1-x^2-y^2), \dot{y} = -x+y(1-x^2-y^2)$

Do the Jacobian and evaluate at fixed point origin. 

Eigenvalues at $\lambda_\pm = 1\pm i$. This is an unstable focus.

Use the Jacobian to find the linearised phase portrait?

Use Polar coordinates. 
$\dot{r} = r(1-r^2), \dot{theta} = -1$

** Week 7

*** Conserved quantities
    - Systems have conserved quantities, and for 2D systems: \[
      \frac{d}{dt}Q(x,y) = \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} \dot{x} +
      \frac{\partial Q}{\partial Y}\dot{y} = 0 \]
    - Thus it is easy to verify a given $Q$ is a conserved quantity of the linear system of a centre
    - It however is not easy to find the conserved quantity for a given system

*** Fist integrals and conservative system
    - The first integral of differential equations is a function that
      is constant on a given trajectory
    - If: \begin{align*} \dot{x} &= g(y)\\ \dot{y} &= f(x)
      \end{align*}
    - Then: $y'(x) = \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{f(x)}{g(y)}$
    - Then: $\int dy g(y) = \int dx f(x) + c$
    - Which can be rewritten as: $c = Q(x,y) = \int_{y_0}^y dy g(y) - \int_{x_0}^x dx f(x)$
    - Reject trivial solutions
**** Example 1
\begin{align*}
\dot{x} &= \frac{p}{m}\\
\dot{p} = -\frac{dV(x)}{dx}\\
\frac{dp}{dx} &= \frac{-dV/dx}{p/m}\\
\therefore E &= \frac{p^2}{2m}+V(x)
\end{align*}

Notes: Generalized coordinates and momenta is always a conserved
quantity *unless* there is an explicit time dependence.  Hamilton
systems with no explicit time dependence have at least one conserved
quantity.


**** Example 2
See page 87, on the hyperbolic surface / linear saddle point

**** Example 3
\begin{align*}
\dot{x}&=-x\\
\dot{y}&=-y
\frac{dy}{dx} &=\frac{y}{x}\\
Q(x,y) &= \frac{y}{x}
\begin{align*}

**** Questions
    - How to go from the conserved quantity to the trajectory?
    - i.e. "Analytically determine the shape of trajectories"
*** Theorem: No attracting or repelling fixed points in conservative systems
*** First Integrals and Trajectories
    1. Fixed points are stationary points of the conserved quantity
    2. Stationary points which are maxima or minima must be surrounded
       by closed trajectories. The presence of linear centres is
       preserved in non-linear conserved systems.
    3. Saddle point of conserved quantity is a saddle point in the
       phase portrait.
    4. Trajectories:
       * Homoclinic trajectories: trajectories which leave the saddle point return to the same saddle point.
       * Heteroclinic trajectories: they leave one saddle to go to another
We are now in a position to find detailed form of the solutions for various non-linear physical systems. 

*** Nonlinear Pendulum
\begin{align*}
T &= \frac12 ml^2\dot{\theta}^2\\
V &= -mgl\cos{\theta}\\
L = T-V &= \frac12 ml^2\dot{\theta}^2 + mgl\cos{\theta}
** Week 8
   
*** Bifurcations
    - System of differential equations contain parameter $a$
    - Bifurcation occurs when critical value $a=a_c$ causes solutions
      to qualitatively change
    - Associated with non-simple fixed points as they are by
      definition unstable

*** Analysis
    1) Simple plotting of say $\dot{x} = a-x^2$
    2) Expansion of $x = \sqrt{a}+\delta$
       - To first order, the factor $\lambda$ multiplying $\delta$
       - $|\lambda|=\sqrt{a}$ represents saddle-node bifurcations

*** Bifurcation Diagram
    - Plots location of fixed points as a function of $a$
    - Dotted/dashed lines are unstable

*** Pitchfork Bifurcation
    - $\dot{x} = ax-x^3$
    - -<- resembles a pitchfork
    - Known as *supercritical pitchfork bifurcation*
    - $\dot{x} = ax+x^3$
    - Known as *subcritical pitchfork bifurcation*
    - $\dot{x} = ax-x^2$
    - Canonical example of *transcritical pitchfork bifurcation*
    - /-

*** General Comments
    - Three cases cover generic, qualitatively different bifurcations
    - Conservation: N(stable fixed points) - N(unstable fixed points) remain constant

*** Bifurcations in 2D

*** Hopf Bifurcation
    - THe appearance of a stable limit cycle is a supercritical HB
    - 

** Week 9 & 10
*** Lorenz Equations

\begin{align*}
\dot{x} &= \sigma(y-x)\\
\dot{y} &= rx - y - xz\\
\dot{x} &= xy - bz
\end{align*}

Canonical values:

\[ sigma = 10, \qquad, b = \frac83, \qquad r = 28 \]

Full eigenvalue equation:

\[ \lambda^3 + \lambda^2(\sigma + b + 1) \lambda (\sigma + r) b + 2b\sigma (r-1) = 0\]

*** Discrete Maps
    - If $f'(x^*) >1$ deviation from fixed point decreases with every
      iteration, *stable fixed point*
    - Else, $|f'(x^*)|<1$ deviation increases, *unstable fixed point*.
    - If $|f'(x^*)=1| then it is marginal and undetermined.
