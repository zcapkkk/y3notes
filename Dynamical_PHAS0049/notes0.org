#+TITLE: Overview (per week) of Dynamical Systems
** Week 1

*** Euler Lagrange Equations

If there are k constraints, there are $k$  equations which are functions
of the coordinates of each of the $N$ particles.

There are $3N-k$ degrees of freedom, each of which can have their own
equation. These are \[ q_j = q_j(x_1,y_1,z_1, ..., x_N, y_N, z_N, t)\]
They can also be called generalized coordinates.

The inverse transformation is given as a function of all of the generalized
coordinates.
** Week 2
*** Hamiltonian
- This is given as the Legendre transformation of the Lagrangian:
- $H = \Sum_i p_i \dot{q_i} - L_i$
- It can be shown that this does not lead to a loss of information
- By taking the derivative with respect to $q_i$ and $p_i$
- And using some identities from Week 1
- The Hamiltonian *must* only be a function of generalised momentum and coordinate
  - Substitute away the velocity
*** Hamilton's Equations 
- $\frac{\partial H}{\partial p_i} = \dot{q_i}$
- $\frac{\partial H}{\partial q_i} = \dot{-p_i}$
- If H is independent of a certain coordinate $q_i$, then the momentum is conserved
- If $\frac{\partial H}{\partial t} = 0$, then H is constant, givn by $H=T-V$
*** Hamiltonian Systems
- Dynamical systems are given by: $\\dot{q}=F_1(q,p), \quad \dot{p}=F_2(q,p)$
- It is Hamiltonian if $\frac{\partial F_1}{\partial q} + \frac{\partial F_2}{\partial p}=0$
*** Conserved Quantities
- In general a Lagrangian with a general K.E. and a potential $V(q_i)$
- Can be shown to be $H=T+V$
- Also because $\frac{dH}{dt} = -\frac{\partial L}{\partial t}
*** Poisson Brackets
- A function of $f(q_i,p_i,t)$ has a time-dependence of:
- $\frac{df}{dt} = \Sum_i\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial q_i}\dot{q_i}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial p_i}\dot{p_i} \right) + \frac{\partial f}{\partial t}$
- Make appropiate substitutions with Hamilton's Equations
- ${f,g} = \Sum_i\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial q_i}\frac{\partial g}{\partial \dot{p_i}}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial p_i}\frac{\partial g}{\partial \dot{q_i}} \right)$ 
**** Properties of Poisson Brackets
     - Linear
     - Satisfies Jacobi Identity: ${{f,g},h}+{{h,f},g}+{{g,h},f} =0$
     - Satisfies Leibniz Rule: $ {f,gh}=g{f,h}+{f,g}h$
*** Phase Space
- A space that is composed of $x(t) = (p_i(t),q_i(t))$
*** Liouville's Theorem
- The volume of a Hamiltonian system is unchanged (can change shape though)
- With the Divergence Theorem:
- $\frac{dV}{dt} = \int_V \Nabla \dot \dot{x} dC = 0$
** Week 3
*** Hamiltonian
    - Is always given in terms of momentum and general coordinate:
    - i.e. $H = H(p_\theta, \theta)$
    - And not $\ddot{\theta}$ for example
** Week 4
*** Bead on Rotating Loop
    - Basically an example in using Lagrangian and Hamilton's equation
    - Maybe go through it again from time to time
*** Small Oscillations
    - Consider a small oscillation where the potential is minimum (derivative of V is zero)
    - Masses can be related to the generalised coordinate
      - Moment of inertia for rotational coordinates
    - A general form of the Lagrangian can be written x
      - With first term being a product of coordinates (see notes)
      - Define a 'coordinate' that is the equilibrium position plus displacement
    - Do a 2D taylor expansion
      - For the potential, drop any term with power order than 2
      - For the KE, only the first mass term survives
	- The other combines with subsequent term to form higher order terms
    - A matrix formulation arises, and an ansatz of $e^{i(kx_k+\phi}$ can be used
    - The determinant gives the amplitudes of oscillations
*** Carbon Dioxide example
*** Classical Field Theory
    - Treat matter as particles lying in a 'mattress'
      - or line if 1D
    - Then take the inter-distance to be 0 and infinite particles
    - Calculate the 'action' across the coordinates
    - This forms the Lagrangian for the field
    - Substituting for string gives the wave equation
    - Lagrangian invariance:
      - The current is equal to the change in charge density
*** Important formulas:
    - Lagrangian density:
      - $L= \frac12 \left(\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t}\right)^2 - \frac{T}{2}\right(\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}\right)^2$
    - EL equation for field:
      - $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi}=\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial (\partial \phi/\partial t)}\right) + \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \right(\frac{\partial L}{\partial (\partial \phi/\partial x)}\right)$
