* Problem sheets

** CW1:
*** Resolution of identity is a bit shaky
*** Change of basis (transformation matrix is just sandwiching the basis?)
*** Linear algebra I guess
** CW2: 
*** Sandwiching new and old states = probability of ground state?
*** Last part of q2 does not make sense
*** Operators of different coordinates commute:
**** Seems obvious but never occur to me
**** But then remember \(L_x, L_y, L_z\) does not commute
**** Raising and lowering which kind of but kind of not makes sense
*** \(\hat{H}\psi = E\psi \) but even for non harmonic potentials as per question specification?
** CW4:  
*** If diagonal matrix, read off eigenvalues and eigenvectors i.e. (100),(010)
*** In general for integration by parts of inner product with a Laplacian
*** The first term (product/no integral) is zero because the wavefunction is zero at infinities (I think?)
*** Integral of odd functions are zero
*** A lot of fancy pants algebra:
**** Symmetry of coordinates \(x_1,x_2\) means swapping or times 2
**** Separation of double integrals results in *products* of Gaussian integrals
**** Do not pull stupid stunts by assuming the sum of coordinates can just be a Gaussian integral

* Past Papers

** 2018

*** Q8

**** Matrix ordering is largest to smallest for l but spin down then up
*** Q10

**** For variational principle, the trial wavefunction can be expanded with orthonormal basis

**** The inner product of the trial function is the sum of the coefficients

** 2019

*** Q1

*** Q2

**** Decompose matrices in terms of Pauli matrices

**** Take middle section

**** Eigenvalues are shifted by constants times identity

**** Eigenvectors should not change / add Pauli matrices?

*** Q3

**** Spot odd/even functions

**** Or use Mathematica to save time
