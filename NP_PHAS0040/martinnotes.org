* Chapter 3 Particle Phenomenology

** Leptons

*** Lepton numbers
Always conserved

*** Lepton Universality
    - The interaction between a lepton and its neutrino is the same
    - Despite the vastly different properties of the different leptons
    - Provided that the mass differences are taken into account
    - Muon is heavier, electron is light, tau survives short etc
