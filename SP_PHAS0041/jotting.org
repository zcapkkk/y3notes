* Marked PSTs

** PST1 

*** Check Q2d again explanations are weird

*** Determination of crystallography

*** The phase velocity equals the group velocity and represents the speed of sound?????

*** Atoms which propagate higher frequency waves and lower frequency waves are indistinguishable IF they differ by \(k+\frac{2\pi}{a}\)

** PST2

*** Reciprocal lattice of bcc is fcc with side \(\frac{4\pi}{a}\)

*** Section 5.3 on thermal conductivity and Fermi energies
