** PST1 

*** Check Q2d again explanations are weird

*** Determination of crystallography

*** The phase velocity equals the group velocity and represents the speed of sound?????

*** Atoms which propagate higher frequency waves and lower frequency waves are indistinguishable IF they differ by \(k+\frac{2\pi}{a}\)

** PST2

*** Reciprocal lattice of bcc is fcc with side \(\frac{4\pi}{a}\)

** Q1 
*** Calculate sine square ratio
*** SC: 100, 110, 111
*** bcc: 110, 200, 211
*** 100 is equal to 001 in cubic but not in tetragonal
** Q2
*** Do not take into account of quenching when Hund's Rules
*** Intrinsic: holes come from excitation of electron to another band
*** Exponential dependence on energy/temperature
*** Always good to have units
*** Temp i is at which 
*** When the intrinsic carrier exceed dopants, doped = pure, intrinsic regime
*** Hund's Rules
*** 3D metals always have quenching (if there is the question will usually ask)
** Q3
*** HOW TO CALCULATE THE AREA OF A HEXAGON
**** "There are six triangles in a triangle composed of the b vectors, and there are 12 triangles in the hexagon, so the total area is just twice of the area of the big triangles, that is how I would do it." --Prof. Pavlo Zubko, 2022
*** Band gap where there are no states at all
*** Bottom of the lower one is higher than the top of the base 
*** Always look at the furthest and the shortest point at the BZB
*** (Otherwise there is always going to be an overlap)
