* Revision

** Crystal
   - Lattice + Basis
   - *Convolution* of lattice and basis
   - Bravais Lattice
   - Wigner-Seitz cell

** Planes of Symmetry

Why are those planes equivalent by symmetry?

** Reciprocal Space

The reciprocal space is simply a fourier transform of the lattice space

** Luue Condition

\[ Q = G\] where \[ Q = k' - k\]

* Week 2

** Bragg Law
   - $2d\sin{\theta} = n\lambda$

** Reciprocal Space
   - Crystal is periodic i.e. (electron) number density is given by:
     \[ n(r+T) = n(r) \]
   - Fourier coefficients define the X-ray amplitudes

** Lecture 1: Low temperature correction to C - Heat Capacity
 - C is defined to be the change in heat required for change in
   temperature.
    - Summary: 
      - Classical Model: equipartition times $\frac12 k_b T$
      - Einstein Model: Derivative of harmonic oscillator with
        occupancy distribution with one frequency
      - Debye Model: Integrate over many frequencies, revisit the
        distribution of k vectors over annular/spherical region
** Lecture 2: Anharmonicity
   - Umklapp event vs Normal Event:
     - Crosses over first bruillion zone introduces vector incoming
       from left
   - The thermal current can be written as energy at $x+l$ where $l$
     is the mean path
   - Then it can be taylor expanded so it can be expressed as
     temperature gradient and heat capacity
   - Produce $\kappa$ term
   - Current equals the 'something' multiplied by the (negative) temperature gradient
 
** Five Steps to determining crystal structure
1. From \(2\theta\) values determine \(sin^2\theta\) values
2. Normalize by smallest values
3. Clear fractions
4. Produce the clear fractions with combinations of hkl
5. Ensure that \(\frac{sin^2\theta}{h^2+k^2+l^2}\) is constant

* 4: Phonon Theory of Heat
  - Heat current:
\[ j_u = -\kappa \frac{dT}{dx}\] Where \[ \kappa = \frac13 v l C_v\]
Where v is velocity of particles, l is mean free path (no collision)
and C is heat capacity 
  - Umklapp process (German for reverse or something)
    - $k_1+k_2$ results in a $k_3$ that extends beyond the B zone
    - Add $G$ so it comes back (or see it as $k_3 + G$ is the *real*
      resultant vector

* 5: Free Electron Theory
** Sommerfield Model and Fermi Energies
  - Use of QM by Sommerfield to explain electronic properties
  - Particle in a box model / Solve TISE |-> Solution in the form of
    exponentials
  - This naturally extends to expressing energy (eigenvalues) in terms
    of wavevector $k$
  - Page 4 derivation equating density states in terms of energy and
    wavevectors
  - At T=0 states up to Fermi energy is filled, so integrate energy
    state density would be equal to electrons in crystals, and the
    Fermi energy can be solved:
    \[ \epsilon_F = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\left(3\pi^2\frac{N}{V}\right)^{2/3}\]
  - Using $\epsilon=\frac{\hbar^2k^2}{2m}$ the Fermi energy can be
    rewritten to represent filled states in terms of $k$. This is
    known as the *Fermi Surface* (important!)
  - This can be substituted into the density function $g$ to get the
    density of states at the surface:
    \[g(\epsilon_F)=\frac32\frac{N}{\epsilon_F}\]
  - Then consider the additional heat capacity of metals
  - This can be explained by: In thermal equilibrium, the number of
    electrons per unit energy range is given by the product of the
    density of states and the Fermi-Dirac distribution function

** Electric Field
   - Particle momentum is given by $\hbar k$, equating time derivative
     of that with Lorentz Force:
     \begin{align*}
     \hbar \frac{d\mathbf{k}}{dt} &= -e\mathbf{E}\\
     \Delta k &= -\frac{e\mathbf{E}}{\hbar}t
     \end{align*}
   - The whole Fermi sphere shifts the same way as the E field but
     opposite
   - Normally accelerate indefinitely, but realistically there are
     collisions
   - Add a damping term $\frac{v}{\tau}$ where $\tau$ is relaxation
     time i.e. where the electron maintains finite drift velocity (?)
     and derive Ohm's Law $j = \sigma E$
   - /Mattheisen's Rule/: The resistivity depends on both the ideal
     resistivity and residual resistivity affected by purity...
 
** Electron Heat transfer
   - Use the kinetic theory again
   - Values - mean velocity same, mean path length is velocity times
     relaxation time and electronic heat capacity
 
** Wiedemann-Franz Law
   - Ratio of E to Thermal Conductivity proportional to temperature
   - Something about different process for conductivity 
** Hall Effect
