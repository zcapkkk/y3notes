* Revision

** Crystal
   - Lattice + Basis
   - *Convolution* of lattice and basis
   - Bravais Lattice
   - Wigner-Seitz cell

** Planes of Symmetry

Why are those planes equivalent by symmetry?

** Reciprocal Space

The reciprocal space is simply a fourier transform of the lattice space

** Luue Condition

\[ Q = G\] where \[ Q = k' - k\]

* Week 2

** Bragg Law
   - $2d\sin{\theta} = n\lambda$

** Reciprocal Space
   - Crystal is periodic i.e. (electron) number density is given by:
     \[ n(r+T) = n(r) \]
   - Fourier coefficients define the X-ray amplitudes

** Lecture 1: Low temperature correction to C - Heat Capacity
 - C is defined to be the change in heat required for change in
   temperature.
    - Summary: 
      - Classical Model: equipartition times $\frac12 k_b T$
      - Einstein Model: Derivative of harmonic oscillator with
        occupancy distribution with one frequency
      - Debye Model: Integrate over many frequencies, revisit the
        distribution of k vectors over annular/spherical region
** Lecture 2: Anharmonicity
   - Umklapp event vs Normal Event:
     - Crosses over first bruillion zone introduces vector incoming
       from left
   - The thermal current can be written as energy at $x+l$ where $l$
     is the mean path
   - Then it can be taylor expanded so it can be expressed as
     temperature gradient and heat capacity
   - Produce $\kappa$ term
   - Current equals the 'something' multiplied by the (negative) temperature gradient
