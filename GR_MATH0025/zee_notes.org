#+TITLE: A. Zee Gravity in a nutshell

** Tensor
Honestly the tensor chapter was pretty bad

** Change in coordinates
*** Metric

**** Metric/distance formula
- The distance can be expressed as: $ds^2 = g_{\mu\nu}dx^\mu dx^\nu$
- Where g is the identity matrix, and indices are expressed with greek
- Thus in D=3 this is equivalent to $ds^2 = dx_i^2 = dx^2+dy^2+dz^2$
**** Metrics
- In Euclidean space it is the identity matrix
- However in other space it is not
  - Polar coordinates
  - Spherical Coordinates
  - Luckily they are both diagonal, although they need not be...
**** First note on indicies
- In general summing over indicies one must go on top and the other bottom
**** Coverting between metrics
- You can find the metric in another coordinate system with:
\begin{equation}
g'_{\rho\sigma} = \g_{\mu\vu}frac{\partial x^\mu}{\partial x'^\rho}\frac{\partial x^\nu}{\partial x^\sigma}
\end{equation}
